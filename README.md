# Weather Forecast
This is a simple weather application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The app allows users to search for a city and view its current weather details like temperature, humidity, and wind speed.
I created this project to improve my frontend development skills and to understand how APIs work in real-world applications.
